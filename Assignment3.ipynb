    "#  Stock purchase recommendations with Machine Learning - using TPOT\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project : \n",
    "The objective is to create a trading suggestion tool for stock buying. The investigation will examine how to incorporate technical analysis into historical stock data as an input to machine learning systems. The information is prepared so that a classification algorithm can determine whether or not a stock should be bought on a certain day.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strategy : \n",
    "The TPOT pipeline_optimizer variable may be used to automatically find the optimal collection of hyperparameters for a classification algorithm trained on a given dataset of stock prices in terms of stock prices.\n",
    "To determine whether a stock's price will rise or fall in the future, TPOT is used to optimise the hyperparameters of a decision tree classifier or a random forest classifier trained on historical stock price data. In order to discover the best settings that maximise the F1 score, a metric of the classifier's accuracy and balance between precision and recall, the pipeline_optimizer would automatically search through various combinations of hyperparameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the TPOTClassifier is a potent tool for automating the hyperparameter tuning process, which may help data scientists and traders who wish to create precise models for forecasting stock prices save time and effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intended Audience:\n",
    "For people or organisations interested in forecasting future stock prices based on previous data, stock price detection would be most helpful.\n",
    "Numerous individuals, such as traders, investors, financial analysts, and data scientists that work in the finance sector, might fall under this category. A financial analyst would use a TPOT model to forecast the performance of a portfolio of stocks, while a trader might use one to decide whether to buy or sell a stock based on anticipated price changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenges:\n",
    "One must select an appropriate time frame, specify the target variable and features, label the data, divide it into training and validation sets, balance the data, preprocess the data, train and evaluate the model, and test it on new data in order to create a labelled dataset for training a supervised machine learning model from price action. Being meticulous and precise while labelling the data is crucial since the quality of your labelled dataset determines how well your machine learning model performs.\n",
    "And thus we are refrencing data from https://github.com/Lindstaedt/Stock-recommendation-with-ML which has extensive data engineering done to create a labelled dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructiosn to construct pipeline :\n",
    "The general stages for building a pipeline utilising TPOT stock data are as follows:\n",
    "1) load and Separate the target variable from the features and divide the data into training and testing sets to prepare it for training:\n",
    "2) Install TPOT and create a pipeline using TPOTClassifier or TPOTRegressor\n",
    "3) For a classification issue with the following parameters, we are utilising TPOTClassifier: generations: The quantity of optimisation iterations. \n",
    "    Number of pipes to keep in each generation, measured in population_size.\n",
    "    Cross-validation folds: The quantity to employ during optimisation.\n",
    "    scoring: During optimisation, employ the scoring function. In this illustration, we're utilising the F1 score.\n",
    "    Random_state: Seed value to guarantee consistency of the outcomes.\n",
    "    Verbosity: The amount of language used during optimisation. This example makes extensive use of language.\n",
    "    Number of parallel jobs to be executed during optimisation, n_jobs. We are utilising every CPU core that is available in this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Following pipeline optimisation, the most effective pipeline may be used to generate predictions on the test set\n",
    "5) Then, measures like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, mean absolute error, mean squared error, and R-squared may be used to assess how well the pipeline is doing. To calculate these measures, one can use the scikit-learn metrics module."

    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "The Covid epidemic caused a sharp market decrease that sparked a recession. Currently, we are trying to determine how badly our economy has been harmed. Stocks often endure a large and protracted decrease in value during a bear market. Numerous causes, including a sluggish economy, increased unemployment, and falling business earnings, contribute to this. Stocks often perform differently in a bear market than they do in a bull market, which is marked by price increases and investor confidence.  We are projecting the stock price in our prototype, and based on the success of our model, we will be able to determine the market's present profitability, which will help us comprehend the current recession."

    "The papers we studied were focussed on finding the best strategies to find the model that gives better accuracies when it comes to predicting stock market or recession. Finding the best machine learning model to forecast stock prices in a bear market brought on by the Covid epidemic is the stated problem. The goal is to understand the current recession and the market's current profitability using this model. Collecting pertinent data, such as historical stock prices, economic indicators, and Covid-related statistics, is the first step in achieving this goal. To make the data suitable for machine learning algorithms, it must first be cleaned, processed, and transformed. The next step is to choose and train various machine learning models using the prepared data, including neural networks, decision trees, random forests, and linear regression. Metrics like mean squared should be used to gauge each model's effectiveness."
